# CSV Query DSL - Technical Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the complete implementation of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for querying CSV data files using ANTLR4 and Python. The project successfully delivers a functional compiler with lexer, parser, and interpreter components that support deferred execution of complex queries on structured data.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objectives
- Design and implement a DSL for CSV data queries
- Build a complete compiler using ANTLR4 and Python
- Support deferred execution with operation accumulation
- Demonstrate language flexibility through 40+ test scripts
- Process real-world data (300 records of online course tracking)

### 1.2 Success Criteria
- ✅ Complete ANTLR4 grammar implementation
- ✅ Functional lexer and parser generation
- ✅ Deferred execution engine
- ✅ Support for all required operations (load, filter, aggregate, print)
- ✅ 40+ diverse test scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Technical documentation and parse tree visualization
